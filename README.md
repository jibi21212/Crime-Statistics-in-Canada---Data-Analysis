# Crime-Statistics-in-Canada---Data-Analysis
This project analyzes crime statistics in Canada using Python. It features data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization tools built with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, providing insights into crime trends and patterns through interactive visualizations.

# Project Title: Scientific Data Analysis Platform

# Description:
This project is a Scientific Data Analysis Platform developed as exploration into data processing, analysis, and visualization techniques. The project was initially created to refine my skills in handling large datasets, performing statistical analysis, and generating insights using Python. It is designed to process and analyze data efficiently, offering a range of tools for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

# Features:

Data Processing: Implements efficient data cleaning and preprocessing workflows using Python and Pandas.
Statistical Analysis: Applies statistical techniques to uncover patterns and trends within large datasets.
Visualization: Provides interactive and static data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to help users understand the insights derived from the data.
Technologies Used:

Languages: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git
